|---|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | `string` | `Garaj` | No | Card title shown in header |
| `temp_sensor` | `string` | — | No | Temperature sensor entity ID |

| `cover_entity` | `string` | — | No | Main cover entity (with up/stop/down controls) |
| `cover_simple` | `string` | — | No | Secondary toggle-style cover entity |
| `light_entity` | `string` | — | No | Light entity to toggle |
| `camera_entity` | `string` | — | No | Camera entity for live feed |
| `door_sensor` | `binary_sensor` | — | No | Door binary sensor entity |
| `motion_sensor` | `binary_sensor` | — | No | Motion binary sensor entity |
| `door_ctrl` | `string` | — | No | Door control entity |
| `distance_entity` | `string` | — | No | Distance/location sensor (optional badge) |
| `camera_refresh_interval` | `number` | `5000` | No | Camera refresh interval in ms |
| `temp_min` | `number` | `0` | No | Minimum value for temperature gauge |
| `temp_max` | `number` | `40` | No | Maximum value for temperature gauge |

All entities are optional — omitting one simply hides that section from the card.

## 🎨 Design

The card uses a dark slate color scheme (`#0f172a` base) designed to blend naturally with Home Assistant's default dark theme. Key design highlights:

- Arc gauge with a smooth blue→green→yellow→red gradient
- Animated needle driven by the live temperature value  
- Color-coded door state (green = closed, red = open, amber = moving)
- Active sensor chips highlighted in amber on motion/door events
- Active toggles illuminate in blue
- Auto-refreshing camera with timestamp overlay
